    but it helps that Devon obviously knows his stuff. There was no saying a magic spell with quantum in it to 
    get from A to B (yes, I’m guilty) and the realities of space travel were starkly and realistically depicted. 
    What also got to me was the engineering here – I found myself nodding my head and smiling upon finding out a
    bout a lathe and milling machine aboard, along with a bit of TIG welding. This ‘realities of space travel’ 
    also extended to a space battle, capture and boarding (no tractor beams involved) and, well, I’ll just leave 
    that there.
    <br/><br/>
    The plot begins with a ship owner who an heiress blackmails to go on a mission she won’t tell him about. 
    The amusing note here is that she is a descendent of him – the guy who built rockets and settled Mars. 
    SpaceX is in there, along with other corporations. Suffice to say, because I don’t want to give too much away, 
    something big has been discovered and the race is on to lock it down. Things are going to get gnarly...`,

What ensues is a thrilling game of cat and mouse as Marcus and Miranda find

characters, Marcus Warnoc and Miranda Foxgrove, are not mere archetypes; they are 
complex, flawed, and deeply human. Their struggle to trust one another and overcome 
their own demons is a powerful allegory for the modern human condition. There are 
class wars, between the very rich and the very poor, but it is not a Marxist story.
 Marcus might be poor and struggling, but he is never a victim. The rich people can 
 be bad, but so can the poor people.
 <br/><br/>
The world of Theft of Fire is one of contrasts: the cold, unforgiving vacuum of 
space and the warmth of human connection. It is a testament to the power of 
storytelling and the enduring appeal of the science fiction genre...`,

<br/><br/>
With his first novel, Theft of Fire, Devon Eriksen has jumped in at the top of the game 
crafting a tale of “hard” science fiction (grounded in plausible science and technology, 
not magic swords and dragons wrapped in technobabble) with complex, believable 
characters who interact and grow throughout the tale, and an artificial intelligence who 
strikes me as far more likely to be what we’ll encounter in our own future than the 
cartoon tales of mindless monsters or transcendent deities sketched by self-styled 
“experts” in machine intelligence...`,

But something happened. Somewhere along the way, our fiction lost hope. Began preaching
our inevitable failure. Began sifting through the ashes of endless visions of decay.
