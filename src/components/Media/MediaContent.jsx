    older science fiction, when all mankind needed to conquer the stars was his will and a spacesuit. The

not magic swords and dragons wrapped in technobabble) with complex, believable

But something happened. Somewhere along the way, our fiction lost hope. Began preaching
our inevitable failure. Began sifting through the ashes of endless visions of decay. 
Began lamenting instead of inspiring. Began, above all, lecturing us for daring to have
