                        <p className='mt-2'>A down-on-his-luck asteroid miner, a mysterious heiress, 
                        an ancient alien race--Devon Eriksen's Theft of Fire weaves these classic elements 
                        into a story that feels refreshingly cutting-edge, with prose as lean and no-frills 
                        as the hero's hand-rolled spaceship. The physics are so tight it feels like he spent 
                        hours plotting out each scene with a slide rule, and the characters so lovingly drawn 
                        I believed in them from the first line of dialog--including one of the most convincing
                        post-GPT AIs I've seen in print. If you're tired of stories that preach at you, 
                        insult your intelligence, or feed you member berries like a kid in a zoo, if you're 
                        after a book that promises a good old-fashioned hard sci-fi adventure in the spirit 
                        of Gregory Benford or James S.A. Corey, and then delivers so much more, then this is 
                        one you won't want to miss.</p>
