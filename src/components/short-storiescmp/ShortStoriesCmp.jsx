                    You're about to go to bed, when you find a woman getting food out of your refrigerator. It turns out, that 'cat' you picked up outside the grocery store, wasn't a cat at all.

                    “Turn around slowly, with your hands… wha… the…” You’d have stammered too, if you saw what I saw. Somebody breaks into your house, you expect a big scary dude, balaclava, maybe a gun. Or a crowbar for prying windows. What I didn’t expect was a bottom. Well, to be honest, it was more of an ass. The kind of ass that writes its own ticket to private events, on top of exactly the pair of legs you’d want for sashaying it in past the velvet ropes.

                “Why do we even need to do this? Swords are for peasants.” Of course it’s the redhead, her voice as grating and whiny as her face is exquisite. I don’t even turn, just reverse my grip and stab the practice sword backwards, right beneath her sternum. Her whining cuts off as she folds around the hard red oak, and I can feel weight slide off it as she slumps to the floor.

                Capable wizards are hired to entertain the king and you, as one, are selected. However, instead, wizards are recruited to join the war. But your skill is just summoning eggs. Should you offer a nice egg to the king in this trying time? Or 'egg-cel' in the war?

                “An unexpected pleasure, Your Egg-selency. Have you brought us an omelette?” His Imperial Majesty Hakkon VI Hafthorsen, his feet over one arm of the Seat of Heroes, sniggers into his winecup, then raises his eyes to sweep the room, and is joined by a belated chorus of somewhat forced titters, from the more silk-swaddled sections of the court. On my shoulder, Cerimatheras stirs and hisses under his breath, his tail stiffening where it twines around my shoulders.

                All too soon, he pulls his wrist away. I pick my head up, try to follow it, cling to his arm, whining my frustration. My need. But the legends aren’t true, at least not in this. I don’t have the strength of ten men. I have the strength of one skinny twelve year old girl. He wrenches his arm free, pushes me down with the other hand, the back of my head back down onto his thighs, pins me as I thrash and hiss and struggle, clawing up at him.
