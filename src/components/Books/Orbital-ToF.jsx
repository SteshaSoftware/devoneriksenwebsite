    BlurbHead: `At the frozen edge of the solar system lies a hidden treasure which could spell 
    their fortune or their destruction—but only if they survive each other first.`,
    MiniBlurb: `An asteroid miner turned space pirate is blackmailed into a perilous mission by a 
    mysterious heiress. Their destination: a heavily fortified archaeological site that guards 
    alien technologies that once reshaped civilization. Using his hard-won spacefarer's knowledge, 
    natural ingenuity and old-fashioned cunning, Marcus must turn the tables and steal his ship 
    back–before she gets them both killed.`,
    Blurb: `<b>Marcus Warnoc</b> has a little problem. His asteroid mining ship—his inheritance, his livelihood, and his home—has been hijacked by a pint-sized corporate heiress with enough blackmail material to sink him for good, a secret mission she won’t tell him about, and enough courage to get them both killed. She may have him dead to rights, but if he doesn’t turn the tables on this spoiled Martian snob, he’ll be dead, period. He’s not giving up without a fight.
    <br/><br/>
    He has a plan.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Miranda Foxgrove</b> has the opportunity of a lifetime almost within her grasp if she can reach it. Her stolen spacecraft came with a stubborn, resourceful captain who refuses to cooperate—but he’s one of the few men alive who can snatch an unimaginable treasure from beneath the muzzles of countless railguns. And if this foulmouthed Belter thug doesn’t want to cooperate, she’ll find a way to force him. She’s come too far to give up now.
    <br/><br/>
    She has a plan.
    <br/><br/>
    They’re about to find out that a plan is a list of things that won’t happen.

            Quote: `A down-on-his-luck asteroid miner, a mysterious heiress, 
    an ancient alien race--Devon Eriksen's Theft of Fire weaves these classic elements 
    into a story that feels refreshingly cutting-edge, with prose as lean and no-frills 
    as the hero's hand-rolled spaceship. The physics are so tight it feels like he spent 
    hours plotting out each scene with a slide rule, and the characters so lovingly drawn 
    I believed in them from the first line of dialog--including one of the most convincing
    post-GPT AIs I've seen in print. If you're tired of stories that preach at you, 
    insult your intelligence, or feed you member berries like a kid in a zoo, if you're 
    after a book that promises a good old-fashioned hard sci-fi adventure in the spirit 
    of Gregory Benford or James S.A. Corey, and then delivers so much more, then this is 
    one you won't want to miss.`,

            Quote: `Theft of Fire combines the kind of enjoyable space opera you'd get in classic 
            Asimov books with a great interpersonal plot and romance and puts it all in a 22nd century 
            hard SciFi setting similar to The Expanse. And it's just awesome!
            <br /><br />
            Creative space combat maneuvers, well detailed action, general problem solving, complex 
            interpersonal conflict, and ample moments of levity make for a novel that you just can't put 
            down.
            <br /><br />
            If you're looking for complex sociopolitical critiques in your SciFi, this book might not be 
            for you. But if you enjoy a good action and adventure SciFi that centers human agency, 
            fallibility, and growth, then you'll love Theft of Fire.
