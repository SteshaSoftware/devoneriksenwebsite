<br/><br/>
1,797 words today so far, 75K words total. Revised structure summary finished. 
<br/><br/>
Some of that word count is outlines and structure, but literal text should emerge faster now. 
<br/><br/>
127 days until November 11. Possibly I can finish the manuscript by then, but probably not with enough time to spare for post-production. 
<br/><br/>
Cover art, editing, beta reads, revisions, layout, marketing copy, release logistics... lot of work. 
<br/><br/>
Targeting the beginning of next year gives me 51 more days. Targeting Christmas, which has obvious advantages, would give me 44 days. 
<br/><br/>
Tricky. We'll see. 
<br/><br/>
Gotta get my 1000 words every day without fail.
    I'll get faster at this with time and repetition, not slower. But right now all I can do is place one foot in front of the other, knowing I will eventually reach Samarkand, because the road is only so long.`,
