<br/><br/>
I had to fire someone again, and the project is now on its third sound engineer. Hiring is the hardest part of running a business. 
<br/><br/>
However, this time I got it right. 
<br/><br/>
Andrew has cleaned up some lingering design issues we had, produced some excellent sample work, and we are now burning through chapters at a fast pace. 
<br/><br/>
Since all raw recording is done, we should have a initial master ready shortly. After that, pickups and post production editing should not take too much longer. 
<br/><br/>
I can't give a firm date estimate, but the project is no longer in limbo... it is moving rapidly. 
<br/><br/>
If you missed out on the kickstarter, the final product will be available wherever audiobooks are sold, except Audible. 
<br/><br/>
Because Audible's business model is based on not paying authors, voice actors, or sound engineers.

Please comment which non-Audible audiobook vendors you like/use. I'd like to make sure I cover any good ones.
