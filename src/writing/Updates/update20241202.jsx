<br/><br/>
Due to cancer-related delays in finishing all the last miscellany of audiobook files, I was unable to book time with our selected audio engineer / audiobook production specialist in a timely manner. 
<br/><br/>
This means either booking later, which means the work would not be finished until February at the earliest, possibly later. 
<br/><br/>
Or seeking another editor, which has risk associated with who I find. 
<br/><br/>
I am currently considering this decision with advice from my team.
