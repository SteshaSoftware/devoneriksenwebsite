    content:  `Time for another status update. 
<br/><br/>
Over the last three months, through a grueling combination of surgery, radiation, and immunotherapy, Sara's cancer is under control... all visible tumors are removed or dead. 
<br/><br/>
She still has more drugs to take, but there a light at the end of the tunnel, and I don't think I hear a train whistle. 
<br/><br/>
Thanks for all your prayers and good wishes. She read every one. 
<br/><br/>
As most of you already know, the schedule for the sequel and the audiobook are in shambles, but starting tomorrow, I should be able to pick up the pieces and get things fixed. 
<br/><br/>
Audiobook is in the hands of the sound engineer, but we are still going back and forth in a feedback loop on the first chapter trying to get the sound just right. Once that is complete, it's just a matter of time. 
<br/><br/>
Sequel is at 93K words, of an estimated 150K. I had hoped to hit 100K by midnight tonight, but between Sara's surgical timetable and the flu, that wasn't happening. 
<br/><br/>
However, while there is much, much writing work to be done, the entire book is outlined in detail, and all plot points, not only major but minor, are settled. I've found Miranda's character voice and I am comfortable writing from her perspective. 
<br/><br/>
Starting tomorrow, I lock the door of my office against wives and cats, limit my commentary on twitter, and set to work, try to find a sustained pace that will get this thing out the door. 
<br/><br/>
While I'm not satisfied with the pace I'm setting (yet), the quality of what I manage to get down does not worry me. I've learned a lot from reader reactions to Theft of Fire, and I think the style, pacing, and flow of Box of Trouble will be a significant improvement.
<br/><br/>
Tonight, we celebrate surviving — literally — this roller coaster of a year.
<br/><br/>
Tomorrow, hermit mode.
