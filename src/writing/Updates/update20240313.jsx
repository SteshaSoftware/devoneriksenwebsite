content:  `Audiobook progress update. Here's what you need to know: 
<br/><br/>
- I have an agreement in place with three excellent voice actors, who will be playing each of the three major roles. They are brilliant, and were selected from hundreds of auditions. 
<br/>
- In addition to those three, I will be voicing some minor characters and other miscellaneous parts. 
<br/>
- An audio engineer has been booked. 
<br/>
- We will be recording synchronously, so the actors can play off each other. I believe this will improve final quality. 
<br/>
- I will personally direct every second of recording.
<br/>
- In summary, this will be a premium-quality production. 
<br/><br/>
- The final product will NOT be available on Audible. Audible takes an effective rate of 87.5% of the sale price on audiobooks. This does not leave enough meat on the bone to pay me and my cast and crew. 
<br/>
- Instead, will be selling on other platforms such as Campfire, which will take 20%, a reasonable and fair vendor cut. We will also sell on any other platforms that offer rates in this range. 
<br/>
- We are looking into the possibility of selling digital hardcopy on USB credit card drives. 
<br/><br/>
- The next step is the kickstarter campaign. We are currently working out goals, tiers, and rewards, as well as planning promotional materials.
