    title: `Audiobook and Kickstarter Update`,
    content:  `I spent yesterday in the studio, recording my author cameo parts for the Theft of Fire audiobook. 
<br/><br/>
And with that final piece, all the raw audio is complete. 
<br/><br/>
We are now in the process of handing over files to the audio engineer, figuring out final sound design decisions, and scheduling the actual finalization work. 
<br/><br/>
I don't have a precise timeframe for completion, but... soon. 
<br/><br/>
Thank you once again to all the Kickstarter backers. 
<br/><br/>
For those of you who ordered packages with: 
<br/><br/>
- Ebooks: these are now available on Bookfunnel for you. Check your emails from Kickstarter. 
<br/><br/>
- Print books: These should ship soon. 
<br/><br/>
- Signed print books: Our garage is full of boxes, and I have a LOT of books to sign. Will start this week. 
<br/><br/>
- Special handmade leatherbound editions: These were meant to be Sara's pet project, as she is our leatherwork expert. Unfortunately, her battle with cancer is consuming much of her energy, focus, and attention, so delivery of these items will probably be delayed. We thank you for your patience. 
<br/><br/>
- Guest appearances by Devon: Please touch base with Christine if you haven't already. 
<br/><br/>
- Special appearances in (cough, dying horribly in) the sequel: I'm working on it, but this, too, will be delayed by cancer. The earliest I have a chance of delivering Box of Trouble would be Q1 2025, probably slipping to Q2. 
<br/><br/>
On behalf of @CDoombeard, @tiny0nion, Ashley-Crossman-who-needs-to-get-a-damn-X-account-already, and myself...
<br/><br/>
Thank you. 
<br/><br/>
All of you. For the opportunity to do this. We've enjoyed ourselves immensely, and produced something made with love. Something we can be proud of. 
<br/><br/>
We think you're going to like it, too.
