    <i>When audiobook?</i>
    <br/><br/>
    The promo video for the kickstarter campaign is being worked on... the script is written, and most resources are in place, including lines from the voice actors. 
    <br/><br/>
    I still need to pick out trailer music, and the editor needs to finish work. 
    <br/><br/>
    Then we can launch the kickstarter. If it funds to basic levels fast, we can begin recording before it ends. 
    <br/><br/>
    The audiobook itself will be about 17 hours. I don't know exactly how long that will take to record. Much depends on the actors' schedules. I will be directing personally, so this will take some focus away from the sequel, but I consider this to be worth it.

    <i>When sequel?</i> 
    <br/><br/>
    About 56,000 words of Box of Trouble are written. This is behind where I planned to be at this time, because of the considerable delay when I had to split the planned story into two books... the events between Theft of Fire and Ocean of Stars simply would not fit in one volume. The Orbital Space series is now scheduled for four books. 
    <br/><br/>
    This meant restructuring a lot of the story. One long book cut in half is not two books, in the same way that one long snake cut in half is not two snakes. Each book needs an initial set of promises, its own arcs, and satisfying conclusions while setting up promises for the next book. 
    <br/><br/>
    Last night, I completed an updated summary, about 6K words long, outlining all my plot updates and resolving several story problems. This is a near-complete plan of action, so the writing can happen faster now. 
    <br/><br/>
    There are still a few details to work out, but many of the struggles of the past few months (splitting the books, finding the right voice for Miranda's POV) are largely behind me. 
    <br/><br/>
    On the flip side, this split also means that a significant amount of material for the third book, tentatively titled Gift of Olympus, has been created ahead of schedule. Once the second book is done, the third may go quicker, although I cannot say how much. 
    <br/><br/>
    I have also been working on ways to streamline the post-production process... beta reading, post-beta edits, line editing, layout, cover design, proofreading. Still, as always, these will impose a significant delay after the manuscript is complete.
    <br/><br/>
    I haven't lost hope of releasing in November again, but that's if I can make up for the unexpected delays. Perhaps I can, but an author's time isn't fungible. Devoting more time to the process doesn't necessary make it happen faster. So there is a strong possibility the release date will slip to early next year.

    <i>When non-fiction book of sociopolitical commentary?</i>
    <br/><br/>
    I know some of you want such a thing. But it would stop the fiction from happening. Non-fictional takes on the madness of current thing are very easy. Fiction is hard. It would be easy to slip into neglecting the latter for the former. 
    <br/><br/>
    <i>Why so much poasting when not yet sequel?</i>
    <br/><br/>
    Because not yet a-list author. I know that from your perspective, you're done with the first book, and the wait for the next one seems long. But one book costs $10-$30, depending on format, and I need to continuously sell them to keep the lights on, as well as build demand for the next one. 
    <br/><br/>
    Any day I take off from commenting halves my sales. Moreover, it's a missed chance at one of those days where I touch a nerve of the world, and sell 100+ books. Each sale creates new readers who help spread the word, so this is important â€” it has a geometric effect. 
    <br/><br/>
    So, for now, I must split my attention between managing publicity and creating additional books. 
    <br/><br/>
    Today, I have three podcast/vidcast appearances, but I'll try to slip some writing in edgewise, because that's what I do. 
    <br/><br/>
    Thanks for all your support. An author's career is hardest at the beginning, and your feedback and enthusiasm keeps me going. 
    <br/><br/>
    There's nothing I'd rather be doing.
