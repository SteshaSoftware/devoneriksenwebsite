Just crossed 90K words on Box of Trouble last night, out of approximately 150K. Some of that word count is summary and will need to be rewritten, but this is a faster process. 
<br/><br/>
I have set a goal of reaching 100K by midnight 12/31, which would allow me to move on and finish the manuscript by possibly late March, given a daily quota of 1000 words. 
<br/><br/>
1000 words may not seem like a lot compared to most writers, but my process is very front-heavy. 1000 words isn't 1000 words of a first draft. It's 1000 words of a manuscript ready for beta reading. 
<br/><br/>
I have been picking up writing momentum as SmallWife's condition stabilizes. We've successfully reduced both tumor count and tumor size, which opens up new options. 
<br/><br/>
I will lose some days to hospitals, but I have hope that there be more 1000-word days as time goes on. 
<br/><br/>
Kickstarter rewards are being readied and packed, and the first wave should go out soon. Our dining room table is stacked full of hardbacks awaiting my pen. 
<br/><br/>
For those of you whose rewards involved personal appearances, those are starting to happen. Contact Christine if you are not being helped already. 
<br/><br/>
My audiobook sound editor troubles are being addressed, and I have received a sample chapter from multiple backup candidates, using some raws I gave them. 
<br/><br/>
Thanks to everyone who stepped up, or helped me find people who did. 
<br/><br/>
I'm still choosing who to go with, but I have multiple candidates who did work that sounds great. This was my first time hearing what the finished product might sound like. I think it's going to be special. 
<br/><br/>
The non-fiction columnist-style writing may slow down a bit in the near future as sequel work ramps up, but I hope to push out a high-focus piece every so often so that subscribers are getting their money's worth. Political commentary and analysis may increase again around Jan 20th, for obvious reasons. 
<br/><br/>
Also, my "Not a Cat" shirt still seems to have a lot of people asking questions already answered by my shirt, so please refer to the picture below.
